#isinstance(<object>, <class>) - This function will tell you whether or not <object> is an instance of <class>. If it could be an instance of several classes, 
#you can use a tuple of classes like so: isinstance(<object>, (<class1>, <class2>, <class3>)).

#issubclass(<class>, <class>) - This function will tell you whether or not one class is a descendent of another class. Just like isinstance(), you can use a tuple of classes to compare against.
    
#type(<instance>) will give you the class for an instance, as will instance.__class__. Neither of these is particularly useful.
